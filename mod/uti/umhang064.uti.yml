  value:
    0: This cloak is cut from dark material - all the better to conceal the stains of the road and of taverns.  It carries the holy symbol of Milil (the god of poetry and song), the very presence of which seems to imbue the wearer with a certain eloquence above and beyond her or his normal talents.
