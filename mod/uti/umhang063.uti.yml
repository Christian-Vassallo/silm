    0: This practical yet stylish cloak carries the symbol of the Harpers, a secret fellowship of heroes who work for the good of humankind and its allied races.  It is unusual for Harpers to show their allegiance so openly - whatever purpose the wearers of these garments may have in revealing their identities, they had best be on the watch for enemies of the Hapers at every turn.
