      The holy symbol of Eilistraee is embroidered in fine thread on the back of this cloak.  Clothing like this is often worn by good drow, in order to identify themselves as followers of the Dark Maiden - thus avoiding misunderstandings with other surface dwellers, who would ordinarily react to drow with hostility.

      This cloak is unusual in that its weaving is mildly enchanted, so that the holy symbol of Eilistraee takes on the colours of the skin and hair of the one who wears it.
