    0: This cloak is a rich red - it has been dyed with Tethan crimson (a symbol of prestige among Red Wizards, but one that has become increasingly difficult to obtain due to the refusal of Teth's newest ruler to trade with Thay).  The protective enchantments that have been woven into the Red Wizard symbol on the back protect the wearer from the Magic Missile spell, while also shielding her or him from most enemies' attempts to dispel other magic.
