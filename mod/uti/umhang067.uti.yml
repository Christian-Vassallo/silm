    0: This non-descript cloak bears the unholy symbol of Bhaal.  The dead patron of murder and assassins still has a number of followers scattered throughout Faerun, who hope to return their master to his former station.  They point to the fact that cloaks like this one have not lost their old Bhaal-given enchantments as a sign that their patron is not wholly lost.
