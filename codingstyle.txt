File: CODINGSTYLE

This document describes the coding style guidelines
for Sternenfall. Code not fitting these criteria
will most likely not accepted into Sternenfall
mainline.

Script Header:
All script files are required to be documented
properly, with a header that contains a
description of what the script does, along with
any mechanics it implements outlined so that a
DM with no prior technical knowledge may
understand it.

Style:
Java-style with curly braces on the same line, really.
See the rest of the scripts to get the picture.
- Indentation is one tab per level.
