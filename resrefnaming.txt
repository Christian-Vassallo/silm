File: RESREFNAMING

This document is a complete list of all resref
naming schemata that are present on
Sternenfall.


Scripts:
- mod_*: module event handler (mod_cliententer)
- i_*: tag-based item event scripts
- a_*: tag-bases area event scripts
- p_*: tag-based placeable event scripts


Areas:

For each shard in the game world, a suitable
_point of origin_ is chosen. This area is
named: tag_n00e00
- *tag* is the unique identifier for this
  shard; a separate list will be kept.
- *n00* is the offset north (or s for south).
- *e00* is the offset east (or w for west).

The areas sorrounding this POO are named with
the direction and an offset.

:         n01e00
: n00w01  n00e00   n00e01
: s01w01
: s02w01  s02e00

Independent areas, such as indoor areas, are
prefixed with the shard-tag, and named as
fitting.

Area Transitions:
Area transitions are done automatically for all
outdoor areas; world builders are free to place
invisible hinting objects to designate
unsuitable spots; they are not required for
operation, however.

Transitions to/from indoor areas are to be done
manually by the world builder.
