Changelog for APS/NWNX

* 2004-04-29: Linux Beta 5.1 pre 4
- Put -lz *back* into the mysql compilation code
- Added -lz detection code to configure, configure will now fail
  and scream when it can't find -lz.
- Fixed buffer overflows in Log() and CNWNXBase::Log()
- Fixed DbMySql::SqlFetch().  Moved the initialization of the return
  buffer to the start of the function.  APS depends on a zero length 
  return to indicate an error and it was set *after* the initial test
  which could fail and return.
